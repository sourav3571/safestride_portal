# Features Integration Walkthrough

I have transformed the "Features" page into an interactive showcase with a global **Safe Mode** system.

### 🚨 ACTIVATE SAFE MODE Button
A large, red **Activate Safe Mode** button is now available at the top of the features page.
-   **Clicking it**: Instantly triggers **ALL** interactive monitoring systems below.
-   **Visuals**: The button pulses, changes to red, and all feature cards gain a red "Live Protection" border.

### Interactive Demos (Global Trigger Support)
When Safe Mode is active:
1.  **Trip Sharing**: Automatically starts the simulated trip and notifies contacts.
2.  **Shake-to-SOS**: Automatically arms and triggers the SOS countdown sequence.
3.  **Voice Activation**: Microphone automatically activates and starts listening for "Help".
4.  **Community & Alerts**: Dashboards update to show "Live Monitoring" status.

This simulates the real-world one-tap protection experience users would have when entering a potentially unsafe area.

### Verification
Navigate to the **Features Page** and click the big red button to see all systems activate simultaneously.
